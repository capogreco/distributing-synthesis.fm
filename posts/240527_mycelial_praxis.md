This essay seeks to contribute to the methodological problematic of research-creation[^1][^2][^3] by formalising a biomimetic, material conception of creative praxis inspired by the figure of fungal mycelia.

## Three Principles

1. Omnidirectional
2. Accumulative
3. Transformational

## Fruiting Bodies

... grown from where the mycelium is most dense, which release DNA-containing spores.

## Mycorrhyzal Relationships

... between research institutions and creative practitioners.

## Discursive Borderlands as Transitional Ecology

Vulnerabilities in hegemonic vocabularies are exploited by the externalising logic of extractative capitalism, creating a discursive borderlands characterised by accumulations of marginalised assemblages.  It is our contention that mycelial praxis, not beholden to disciplinary constraints, holds unique hope for reengaging in these externalised assemblages.
