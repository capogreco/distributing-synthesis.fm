## Problem

**There are currently very few music instruments made from the material and processes of the internet.**

... and of those that we do have, insufficient care has been applied to nurturing their affordances and scrutinising their various complicities.

## Aims

To investigate the potential impact distributed synthesis may have on the creative horizon of our collective technological becoming.

## Domains of Investigation

### Texture

### Ritual

### Emergence

## Methods

The research methods I am intending to use to investigate distributed synthesis' potential in this way are:

1. Diffractive reading
2. Careful design
3. Mycelial praxis

### Diffractive reading

Diffractive reading takes a posthumanist / cybernetic ontology as its starting point, and posits the researcher as belonging to a material world in which all things, singularly and in groups, can be said to recieve, store, process, and emit information.[^1]

Information, and discourse more generally, is understood as material signal subject to constructive and destructive interferance, depending the positions of the emitter, reciever, and diffractive environs. [^2]

Diffractive reading therefore entails a research stance that is explicitly embedded in the cultural machinery of knowledge production, and posits the researcher as being in some way responsible for the recieving, storing, processing, and emitting of information relevant to their project.


### Careful design

Inheriting from Boris Groys' A Philosophy of Care,[^3] careful design is invoked here as a research meathod to represent the practice of scrutiny regarding what commitments are brought into the design process.

A careful approach may not, for example, dive unthinkingly into the implementation of interaction simply for interaction's sake, without scrutinising the role interaction plays in maintaining the facade of freedom, expression, control, etc. in the techno-utopian logic that undergirds technological consumption, and which functions to obscure forms of vectoralist[^4] / techno-feudal[^5] oppression, *for example*.
