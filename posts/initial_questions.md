Some questions posed to me by my primary supervisor, Darrin Verhagen.

### What makes this research consequential?

My project hinges on the hypothesis that there may exist, an upstream relationship from what Gary Tomlinson broadly terms "musicking rituals"[^1], to what I want to be able to refer to as the *creative horizon of our collective technological becoming*.  

We might posit Wark's concern regarding those heretofore invisible forms of oppression associated with the emergence of the vectoralist superstructure[^2][^3], as demarcating a paucity regarding what is included and excluded from exactly this creative horizon.  Similarly, we might posit Doctorow's anxieties regarding governments' mis-regulation of computational inter-operability[^4] as similarly demarcating an insufficiency in this creative horizon; just as do Varoufakis' apprehensions regarding the rise of technofeudalism.[^5]

More specifically, this project pertains to our relationship with our phones.  That despite the utopian ideals of the internet protocols on which their usefulness is predicated, almost every interaction we have with our phones, every notification, every touch, every byte of information, is passed to and from us, via a very large multi-national corporation, seems to me that there is something to be reclaimed here.

In terms of what might be entailed in such a reclamation, this project isn't not about digital literacy.  High schools are burned out from the 2010 push for all students to learn programming, a push for which educators were ill-equipped for at the time.  However, creative coding has matured since then, and represents a practical path forward on this front.

So, if we have the pedagogical resources, what is stopping us?  This research posits music performance rituals (in the broadest possible sense) to be upstream cultural determinant of our attitudes towards technology, and attempts to imbed an implicit commitment towards the reclamation of this technological creative horizon within the material parameters of said ritual, via the design of a digital music instrument (DMI).

There is much more to say on this topic, such as the role of music in establishing the quilting points with which language, via bodies, organises material.  This is thrown into sharp relief if was can understand music to be that along with which one is invited to dance.  Music is not, as Edgard Ver√®se once put it, "organised sound",[^6] but rather, organis*ing* sound - sound which *organises*.

It is here that we can see that it is inasmuch as the prosody of their caregiver is *musical* that infants are invited to make their first movements towards language use.  What does it mean for this prosody to be *musical*?  Simply that it contains an invitation to dance along; to take up, and be taken up into a primeval sense of correctness which corresponds with, in the case of our infant learning to talk, the set of commitments required for language use.  In dancing along to a caregiver's prosody, an infant adopts those commitments they require to eventually participate in the institution of conversation.

What happens in infant-directed speech is not just language and music, but dance also: indexing the materials and objects in the environment.  It is through this indexing that our relation to technology is initialised in language.  What objects can be used, and what is it that we use them to do?  It is exactly this that ends up being the creative horizon of our collective technological becoming, and it is exactly this that we are revisiting, and tinkering with, in music performance rituals.

It is perhaps no coincidence that large cultural revolutions have tended to occur only alongside musical revolutions, which seem always to occur alongside the appearance of new forms of musical instruments.

And how are the paths paved from the music performance ritual towards the creative horizon?  Via *inference*.[^7]

What can be inferred from the design and construction of the piano?  And how might these inferences correlate with the social transformations which occurred alongside its emergence?  We could ask similar questions of the pipe-organ, zither, electric guitar, synthesiser, etc.

So what does this all mean for careful design of digital music instruments today?  It means we might prefigure our commitments latently in the design of the instrument so they become an implicit part of the primeval sense of correctness the audience is invited to adopt, inasmuchas what they hear might be musical.

### Is what you are exploring in any way related to perceived effortfulness?

Yes!  My current thinking is to categorise my explorations into three categories: texture, ritual, and emergence.  

Texture: that which compositionally, and with regards to synthesis, attends to the opportunity (and spectre) of massive polyphony present in distributed synthesis accross *n* devices, and which gives some indication of what can be done with it.[^8]

Ritual: those material parameters which invite the audience to listen a specific way, including the architecture, environment, method of control input, etc.

Emergence: what happens subsequent to ritual in the socio-cultural field, including any effect, if any, on participants' creative horizon of collective technological becoming.

So, explorations regarding perceived effortfulness would fall mostly within the terrain of texture (in terms of how to synthesise and compose with it), but also ritual (in terms of how it is controlled and how the audience is invited to listen to it).  

Already via these two things we might postulate that the third category, emergence, may also come into play.  For example, some method of control which uses posture (that register in which our expectations are normally implicitly managed) for musical control (such as Iran Sanadzadeh's floors), may give rise to forms of embodied computation which may direct the flow of inferential explication in specific directions.

My spontaneous instinct is to draw on Lacan's four discourses[^9] to help diagramatise how music performance rituals may quilt into discourse, which I would be happy to elaborate upon in another post.
